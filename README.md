### Introduction

The ripple application periodically calls rippledâ€™s server_info command and records the sequence number of the latest validated ledger along with the current time. The retrieved information is then serialized into a "server_info.dat" file, which is then used to construct a plot using GNUPLOT. The application was programmed in Java using the Swing framework to provide a simple user friendly UI. The application supports both JSON-RPC requests over HTTP and WebSockets, and allow to select the frequency as well as the number of polling occurences.
